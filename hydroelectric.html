Hydroelectricity, or hydroelectric power, is electricity produced from hydropower. 
In 2015, hydropower generated <b><U>16.6% of the world's total electricity</b></u> and <B><u>70% of all renewable electricity</u></b>, and was expected to increase by about 3.1% each year for the next 25 years. 
Hydropower is produced in 150 countries, with the Asia-Pacific region generating 33 percent of global hydropower in 2013. China is the largest hydroelectricity producer, with 920 TWh of production in 2013, representing 16.9% of domestic electricity use. The cost of hydroelectricity is relatively low, making it a competitive source of renewable electricity.
 The hydro station consumes no water, unlike coal or gas plants. </font></i></td>
